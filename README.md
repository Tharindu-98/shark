A Flutter server rendering framework

## What it is

Shark is a server rendering framework, a server-driven UI framework.

Simple use case of shark

Let say you have a `text` widget, you specify it as json on the server return to the client,
the client use shark to receive the text widget and show the UI successfully.

After a while, you want to change the text widget to a `button`, instead of modify it on the client code and go through all the mobile app store update process,
you only need to modify the text widget to a button widget on the server, and the shark client received it, showed the newest UI.

## How to use

First, `init` Shark library on main method on your application

```dart
  void main() {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await Shark.init(hostUrl: 'http://yourhost.com');

    runApp(MyApp());
  }
```

Second, set up UI widget

* To be noticed, every thing related to widget is controlled by `SharkController`
* `get` method is where we send the request

``` dart
  late final SharkController _controller;

  /// init the shark controller
  @override
  void initState() {
    _controller = SharkController.fromUrl(path: '/container',)..get();
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SharkWidget(controller: _controller);
  }
```

To redirect to another page, call `redirect`

```dart
_controller.redirect('/your_new_path');
```

To refresh current page, call `refresh`
```dart
_controller.refresh();
```

If you want to create your own parser

``` dart
class MyCustomParser extends SharkParser {}
```

## Routing

 `shark` auto handles your page routing, if you do not want it, set `handleClickEvent` to false

``` dart
 _sharkController = SharkController('/your_path', handleClickEvent: false);
```

### Click Event

<p> Routing trigger by click event, which you can set it like this on your json widget file.

A sample event json format

```json
    {
        'type': "container",
        'click_event': 'route://your_path?xxx=xxx'
    }
```

`schema`: xxx://
`path`: your_path
`argument`: After the prefix `?' is the argument field.
xxx=xxx, separate with `&`

The schema `route` represents the routing action

Currently, there are 4 routing action

`route`: prefix with 'route://', internally would call [Navigator.pushName('new_path', args)]

Push a new route to [Navigator]

** Please remember to specify `route path` on your route map
If not, navigator would throw an error
then SharkController would try to navigator to a new default shark widget with the following path

`pop`: prefix with 'pop://', internally would call [Navigator.pop(result)]

`redirect`: prefix with 'redirect://', redirect current page with the following path

`link`: use `url_launcher` internally to open a url on browser, please visit [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) to configure the detail requirements for each platform



## Caching

`Shark` use [dio_cache_interceptor](https://pub.dev/packages/dio_cache_interceptor) for caching purposes.

When you initialize the shark library, you can pass a `cacheStrategy` argument to config your caching setting.

## Parsing

Note that Shark uses [dynamic_widget](https://pub.dev/packages/dynamic_widget) for widget parsing,

If you want to create your own parser

``` dart
class MyCustomParser extends SharkParser {}
```

To view the json format, go visit [documentation](https://github.com/dengyin2000/dynamic_widget/blob/master/WIDGETS.md) on dynamic_widget.


## OTHER
You can also view the [express server sample](https://github.com/lau1944/shark-server), you can deploy to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) fast

or you can test it on this temporary host =(little slow)

### Real world sample (Promotion ðŸ˜‚)

My new meditation app had implemented `shark` recently, the `profile` page is handled by `shark` completely.
